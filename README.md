# 1NT20CS020

I got a late start on it because I was out. Ended up with just 2 hours to tackle the whole full stack thing. I was actually aiming for the backend part, but when I finally started at 11 AM, I thought, why not give the fullstack a shot?Managed to finish up the backend part in that short time, but gotta admit, the front end got the better of me. I couldn't wrap it up like I wanted to.  If there's any chance I could get another shot, I'm pretty sure I can show off my frontend skills better. I'm all in to put in the extra effort.

- Also first I used my rollnumber 1NT20CS020 but couldn't catch the clientID and secret . Then used NT20CS021 for registering.
